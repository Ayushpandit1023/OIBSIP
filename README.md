3: 


# Project 1: [data cleaning]
Discription: Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete
data within a dataset. Messy data leads to unreliable outcomes. Cleaning data is an essential
part of data analysis, and demonstrating your data cleaning skills is key to landing a job. Here
are some projects to test out your data cleaning skill

# Project 2: [House Price Prediction]
Description: The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a
numerical outcome based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a
fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in
developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.

# Project 3: [wine quality prediction]
Description: The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a
real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset
encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the
features for three distinct classifier models.
